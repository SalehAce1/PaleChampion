Dreamnail dialogue:
	This place, familiar yet different...
	A construct of memory and dream?
	For what purpose?
	The Blackwyrm's resonance, faint, only a Fool's memory here.
	Power, not stronger than my King, but different...

Ending Dialogue:
	The Knights, they defeated that ancient Wyrm, made Fools of his followers.
	But if a Wyrm can die, then what of our King? Is he the God we deemed him to be, or is he a Fool also?
